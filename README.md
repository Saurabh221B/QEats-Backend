# QEats-Backend
QEats- It ia basically Java backend for a mock food ordering app.
I have contributed to this project to understand backend development with Java stack and springboot.

Contributed to  different parts of the QEats food ordering app backend which is a Spring Boot application use to retrieve list of 
restaurants from MongoDB based on a user location.

• Implemented Several REST API endpoints to query restaurant information based on different search parameters. 

• Improved the app performance under large load scenarios by implementing Redis as a cache
